## 2022-10-01: 2022q3 release

This release covers everything from 2022-07-01 and has been tested with avr-gcc
v10.2.0 from Upstream and arm-none-eabi-gcc 10.3-2022.07 from Arm.

Breaking changes:

- None.

Features:

- RP2040 external flash size option.
- RP2040 ADC driver.
- Resolution configuration for DS18B20 driver.
- Use GPIO signal to configure STM32 Timers.

Integrated Projects:

- printf upgraded to v6.0.0.

Fixes:

- SpiMaster compilation with GCC11.
- Using RTT with multiple channels.
- Relocation of lbuild outpath in `modm:build:make` module.
- Deadlock RP2040 DMA driver due to counter overflow.
- Fix compilation of moving average for floating-point type.

New development boards:

- Feather-RP2040 as `modm:board:feather-rp2040`.
- ThingPlus-RP2040 as `modm:board:thingplus-rp2040`.

New device drivers:

- ADS7828 ADC as `modm:driver:ads7828`.
- MCP9902/3/4 temperature sensor as `modm:driver:mcp990x`.
- ST7789 display driver as `modm:driver:st7789`.

Known bugs:

- C++20 is not fully implemented by GCC10 yet, however modm does not use all
  features yet anyways. See #326.
- STM32F7: D-Cache not enabled by default. See #485.
- `lbuild build` and `lbuild clean` do not remove all previously generated files
  when the configuration changes. See #285.
- Generating modm on Windows creates paths with `\` that are not compatible with
  Unix. See #310.
- `arm-none-eabi-gdb` TUI and GDBGUI interfaces are not supported on Windows.
  See #591.
